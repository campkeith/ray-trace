  <h1>Machine Problem 5</h1>
  <p>For machine problem 5, you will be working on parts of a ray tracing engine.</p>

  <h2>Checkpoint 1</h2>
  <p>Complete the implementation of the scene file parser in <var>input_file.c</var></p>
  <h3>Grading rubric</h3>
  <p>Note that the line length limit has been extended to 120 characters.  This
     should allow you to improve your style and reduce the use of vertical space
     so that more code can fit on the screen.  Also note that module level
     documentation is already provided, so there is no need for an introductory paragraph.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Functionality: 30 points</dt>
      <dd>Score is based on the results of automated tests</dd>
    <dt>Variable, function names: 5 points</dt>
      <dd>Variable and function names describe what they do.</dd>
    <dt>Style: 5 points</dt>
      <dd>Indentation style is consistent</dd>
      <dd>Tabs are not mixed with spaces when indenting lines</dd>
      <dd>Code is visible on screen without excessive vertical space</dd>
      <dd>Style does not make code hard to read</dd>
      <dd>Lines are not excessively long (>120 characters).</dd>
    <dt>Logic: 5 points</dt>
      <dd>Logic is straightforward, not convoluted</dd>
      <dd>Systematic decomposition is used where appropriate</dd>
    <dt>Documentation: 5 points</dt>
      <dd>Code is self-documenting where the logic is obvious</dd>
      <dd>Where comments are appropriate they are clear and concise</dd>
  </dl>
